# Epilleptic-Seizure-Recognition
Researched and analyzed existing literature on epileptic seizure recognition techniques using EEG signals.

Gained in-depth knowledge of EEG signal processing and feature extraction methods.
Identified the potential of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for extracting frequency components from EEG signals.
Developed a Python codebase for preprocessing the EEG dataset and performing the DWT.

Implemented the DWT using the PyWavelets library.
Extracted relevant features from the DWT coefficients and created a feature matrix.
Utilized various machine learning algorithms for epileptic seizure recognition.

Employed k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Trained and fine-tuned each classifier with the DWT features.
Conducted rigorous experimentation and evaluation to assess the performance of different classifiers.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets for unbiased evaluation.
Calculated accuracy scores for each classifier to measure recognition efficiency.
Identified k-NN, ANN, Naive Bayes, and SVM as the most efficient methods for epileptic seizure recognition based on the DWT features.

Python: Programming language commonly used for developing machine learning models due to its extensive libraries and frameworks.
scikit-learn: Python library that provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms and tools for model training, evaluation, and preprocessing.
NumPy: Python library for efficient numerical computations and handling multi-dimensional arrays, often used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis, commonly used for handling datasets and performing exploratory data analysis.
TensorFlow or Keras: Libraries for implementing and training artificial neural networks (ANNs). TensorFlow is a more low-level framework, while Keras is a higher-level API built on top of TensorFlow.
